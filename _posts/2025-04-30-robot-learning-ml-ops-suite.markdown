Deep learning has become essential for robots to operate and perform complex tasks in unfamiliar or dynamic environments. However, infrastructure and tooling for robot learning is largely insufficientâ€“especially for integrated testing and evaluation of model performance in the real-world. To solve this problem, we're working on an MLOps Suite for robot learning. You can think of it as the Weights and Biases of robot learning.

# Next Steps
In the video above, we were logging fake data to Xpy from a laptop. Next up, we'll be showing the full workflow with a raspberry pi logging data to Xpy to demonstrate how Xpy handles real data from real external hardware.
